# Experimental Projects

These projects are completely experimental.

I'm trying to experiment with awesome technologies (_especially new ones_) to
advance my knowledge. Mostly are the basics of the technologies. But, the
important thing is that they're fuck'n working. So, can be used as a boilerplate.

TODO: Put index to the directory/project internals here and descriptions.
