# sinon.js

* **Spy.** Test code that observes calls to functions outside of the code under test. Spies do not interfere with the operation of those external functions; they merely record the invocation and return value.

* **Stub.** Test code that stands in for calls to functions outside of the code under test. The stub code doesn’t attempt to replicate the external function; it simply prevents unresolved errors when the code under test accesses the external function.

* **Mock.** Test code that mimics functions or services outside of the code under test. With mocks, test code can specify the return values from those functions or services so it can verify the code’s response.
